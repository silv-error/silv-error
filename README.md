## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) with a passion for backend development. With hands-on experience in full-stack development, I have served as the backend developer for my school club, where I collaborated on projects that involved building systems and cloning websites with useful features for our community. I thrive on solving complex problems and am always eager to learn new technologies to enhance my skills.
